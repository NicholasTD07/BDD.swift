# spec.swift

Pure Swift BDD framework

## What can it do?

Runs the set up hooks (`before`, `after`) and also the tests.


**Matchers**

It does verify things now. Just not all the following though...

```swift
let love = false
expect(love).to.beTrue()

let dock: [Icon] = ["ðŸ“”", "ðŸŽµ", "ðŸ“·"] // real apps!
expect(dock).to.beEmpty()

let shopping = ToDo("Buy milk")
let todos: [ToDo] = [ shopping ]
expect(todos).to.contain(shopping)
```

It can do these now:

```swift
expect(42) == 42
expect(42) != 2017

// Also, the above works for values wrapped in Optional
let optional: Int? = 42
expect(optional) == 42

expect(["an array"]).to.beEmpty()
expect(["an array"]).to.contain("another array")
```

More matchers coming soon!

### What it cannot do?

**Async Tests**

Nope. Not those. Not now.

## Usage

Coming soon

## Try it out

1. Clone the repo
2. Have Swift 3 installed (if you haven't already got it - you should)
3. `cd` into this repo's path
4. `swift test`

You should see something like this.

```
.....F
/path/to/spec.swift/Tests/specTests/specTests.swift:75:14: error: test failed
6 examples, 1 failed, 5 passed.
```

This is proof for all the setup, teardown and also the tests are run.
Also the test result reporter is working properly.

You can also add or change the tests in the `specTests.swift` file.

## Git workflow

I'd like to keep the branch/history graph as simple as it can be. So,

only merge branches with "Rebase and merge" option. OR,

do it in cli with `git merge --ff-only feature-branch`
